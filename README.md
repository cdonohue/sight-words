# Sight Words

> [Demo](https://sight-words-practice.netlify.com)

This app was made to both help my daughter learn her sight words and also as an opportunity to show my kids a little bit about what I do everyday as a developer/designer.

Right now, this is geared towards kindergarten sight words so individual mileage may vary. I might add some more difficult words and maybe a grade selection at a later time.

Enjoy!

> You will have fewer bumps in the experience if you use Google Chrome, since that supports speech from a microphone. With that being said, you'll need sound (speakers or headphones) and a microphone to speak into. Keep in mind that there might be a few bugs in the speech recognition and voice synthesis as we work on making this experience better.
